#Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

This is where I keep all of my configuration files for a series of different programs that gives it a unique experience over the defaults.
    
## TODO
- Better .emacs for emacs.
    - also a better colorscheme tbh
- lemonbar!!!
    - going to start using lemonbuddy. 
    - be sure to read up on the configuration of the different modules
- vim statusline
    - still don't have the colorscheme that I want though...
- i3 
    - give it a readme so you can remember the crap that you put in it
    -halfway done on that readme ;)
- Write a better readme ;)
- Custom startpage
- I'll think of more things soon enough

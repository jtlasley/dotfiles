#Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

This is where I keep all of my configuration files for a series of different programs that gives them a unique experience over the defaults.
    
## TODO
- Better .emacs for emacs.
  - now using that .Xresources reader colorsheme  
- lemonbar!!!
    - or no lemonbuddy
    - just reading that z3bra blogpost
- vim statusline
    - still don't have the colorscheme that I want though...
- Write a better readme ;)
- Custom startpage
- I need to get a set of themes going
    - maybe manage them with zenbu, or just have a bunch of things commented out.
    - atm starting to do the whole comments thing
- How do I configure rofi?
